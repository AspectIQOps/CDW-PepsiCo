# Title: Complete Docker Stack Setup and Credential Management
# Description: Performs stack cleanup, building, deployment, and waits for the 
# database to be healthy, prioritizing local environment variables with a 
# fallback to AWS Secrets Manager for credentials if they are empty.

# --- MANDATORY FIX: Source the .env file to load local variables ---
# 1. 'set -a' enables auto-exporting of all subsequent variables.
set -a
# 2. '.' (source) loads the .env file into the current shell context.
. ./.env
# 3. 'set +a' disables auto-exporting.
set +a
# --- END MANDATORY FIX ---

# --- Configuration & Variable Loading ---
